Note that the raw data from the Google Form responses contains 2 responses that are erroneously marked "Video."

The first draft of the Google Form accidentally labels the "Audio Clip" treatment group as "Video", which was realized after
administering the experiment to the first 2 participants.

So 2 responses are marked "Video." Those responses were manually changed to the correct group, "Audio Clip" within the Excel file 
in the raw data subfolder.
